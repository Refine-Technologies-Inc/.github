### What We Build

Refine is a deep-review engine for technical documents. It uses an agentic pipeline of frontier AI models to read a draft end-to-end, track detailed arguments, and surface the kinds of substantive issues an expert reviewer would flag.

- **Expert-level depth** — Feedback comparable to a careful 4–6 hour expert read-through, delivered in minutes
- **Order of magnitude deeper** — Coverage far more thorough than frontier models, even with expert use
- **Built for complexity** — Especially strong on long, technical, or complex documents where precision and internal consistency matter

Our core users are researchers at leading universities, think tanks, and central banks.
