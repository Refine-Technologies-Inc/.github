### What We Build

Refine is a deep-review engine for technical documents. It uses an agentic pipeline of frontier AI models to read a draft end-to-end, track detailed arguments, and surface the kinds of substantive issues an expert reviewer would flag.

- **Expert-level depth** — Feedback comparable to a careful 4–6 hour expert read-through, delivered in minutes
- **Order of magnitude deeper** — Coverage far more thorough than frontier models, even with expert use
- **Built for complexity** — Especially strong on long, technical, or complex documents where precision and internal consistency matter

Our core users are researchers at leading universities, think tanks, and central banks.

### Our Stack

**Backend** — Python, FastAPI, Celery, Redis queues for orchestrating multi-stage agentic pipelines at scale

**Frontend** — TypeScript, TanStack (Router, Query), React

**Infrastructure** — Azure, Pulumi IaC, containerized deployments

**AI** — Custom LLM routing across OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini among others.
